# Number-Guessing-game-Puthon

This is a simple **console-based number guessing game** written in Python. 
The player has to guess a randomly selected number within a specific range.

# 🎮 How It Works

- The computer picks a random number  between 1 and 10.
- The player is asked to guess the number.
- The game ends when the player guesses correctly.

#💡 What I Learned

- Using `input()` and `print()` for user interaction
- Generating random numbers with the `random` module
- Using loops and conditional statements
- Handling basic user input and logic flow

# 🚀 Features

- Simple and interactive gameplay
- Clear win message when guessed correctly

# 🛠 Future Improvements

- Add input validation (e.g., check for non-numeric input)
- Add difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
- Track high scores
- Allow the user to play again without restarting

1. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3+ recommended)
2. Save the script as `Number Guessing game.py`
